    Using types with Salesforce's Lightning Web Components (LWC) is a good way
    to
    <strong
      >improve developer experience, productivity and code reliability</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="article-text">
    There are different ways to use types such as JSDoc, TypeScript, TypeScript
    with checks and TypeScript in strict mode, listed from the least
    constraining to the most constraining. The more constraining ways offer more
    safety regarding bug checking but seemingly demand more work.
  </p>

  <p class="article-text">
    Typing demand more work when you write new code, but in the long run, every
    time you update code, you can rely on typing and the editor to warn you
    about errors and needed modifications. It means you don't have to provide
    the mental energy and time needed to check everywhere a variable is used to
    be sure the changes are non-breaking.
  </p>

    You can find a fork of the LWC recipe with the modifications discussed in
    the article here:

  <h3 class="article-title">Weak auto-completion by default</h3>
  <p class="article-text">
    When you write JavaScript, your code editor is able to provide some sort of
    auto-completion based on the code you previously wrote. It does not work
    very well with plain JavaScript and we will see how to improve that by
    modifying the
    <a
      href="https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes/blob/main/force-app/main/default/lwc/todoList/todoList.js"
      class="link"
      target="_blank"
    >
      todoList.js
    </a>
    file from Salesforce's LWC recipes repository. We are using Visual Studio
    Code as our code editor, but other IDE also have similar features.
  </p>
  <p class="article-text">
    If you hover over the <span class="hljs-name">_todos</span> variable in the
    file, the IDE will tell you that it just knows the variable is an array of
    type "any" which can be anything.
  </p>
  <div class="my-4 mx-auto w-10/12 rounded">
    <app-fullscreen-container>
      <img
        class="w-full"
        src="assets/lwc-typing-article/var-hover-any.png"
        alt="Hovering an untyped variable"
      />
    </app-fullscreen-container>
  </div>
  <p class="article-text">
    When you use this variable as shown in the next GIF the editor doesn't tell
    you what property the element of the array has. You have to do the effort to
    look around how the array is initialized or passed down to the todoList
    component in order to know that the elements have for properties
    <span class="hljs-name">priority</span>,
    <span class="hljs-name">description</span> and
    <span class="hljs-name">id</span>.
  </p>
  <div class="mt-4 mx-auto w-10/12 rounded">

        alt="Failed auto-completion"
      />
    </app-fullscreen-container>
  </div>

  <h3 class="article-title">JSDoc</h3>
  <p class="article-text">

      class="link"
      target="_blank"
    >
      JSDoc
    </a>
    tags are comments with a specific format that you add to your code and are
    parsed by tools to build documentation. For us, JSDoc are tags that are
    understood and used by the editor to assist us.
    <br />
    We add a tag to define the type TodoJsDoc and a tag to apply this type to
    the <span class="hljs-name">_todos</span> variable.
  </p>
  <app-code-snippet
    language="javascript"
    code="
/**
  * @typedef {Object} TodoJsDoc
  * @property {number} id
  * @property {string} description
  * @property {boolean} priority
  */

/** @type {TodoJsDoc[]} */
_todos = null;
    "
  ></app-code-snippet>
  <p class="article-text">
    The auto-completion is now possible as shown in the following GIF.
  </p>

  <app-fullscreen-container>
    <img
      class="w-full"
      src="assets/lwc-typing-article/JSDoc-auto-completion.gif"
      alt="JSDoc auto-completion"
    />
  </app-fullscreen-container>

  <p class="article-text">
    Once you defined a type in a file you can reuse it in other files. In our
    example we would reuse the type wherever the TodoList component is used to
    know quickly the shape of the data that has to be passed down with the todos
    attribute.
  </p>

  <p class="article-text">
    The typing helps to <strong>write new code faster</strong> when it's related
    to the todoList because auto-completion helps, especially if you are coming
    back to code that you are not familiar with anymore.
  </p>
  <p class="article-text">
    JSDoc types can match the needs of your project, but the tag syntax can be
    complicated to write. If you go down that road you might want to find a good
    JSDoc extension to help you. In the next part we'll define types with
    Typescript, which is less verbose than JSDoc types.
  </p>

  <h3 class="article-title">TypeScript and JSDoc</h3>
  <p class="article-text">
    TypeScript (TS) is a popular language that is like a stricter, structured
    and typed JavaScript. Projects that use this language have source files
    written in TypeScript and a build step to transpile the code into
    JavaScript. This build step doesn't fit Salesforce projects, but we can
    still
    <strong
      >use the power of TypeScript files, without changing our whole project
      structure</strong
    >, by defining types in TypeScript files and referencing those types in
    JSDoc tags.
  </p>
  <p class="article-text">
    To do that let's create the file todo.ts in its folder
    lwc-recipes\force-app\main\default\lwc\todoList\.
  </p>
  <app-fullscreen-container>
    <img
      class="w-full"
      src="assets/lwc-typing-article/todoListFolderWithTS.png"
      alt="folder with TypeScript File"
    />
  </app-fullscreen-container>
  <p class="article-text">The content defines the type with the TS syntax:</p>
  <app-code-snippet
    language="typescript"
    code="
      type TodoTypescript = {
        id: number;
        description: string;
        priority: boolean;
        // TS syntax => variableOrPropertyName: Type;
      };
    "
  ></app-code-snippet>
  <p class="article-text">Let's update the JSDoc tags to use this type:</p>
  <app-fullscreen-container>
    <img
      class="w-full"
      src="assets/lwc-typing-article/TSDoc-auto-completion.gif"
      alt="TSDoc auto-completion"
    />
  </app-fullscreen-container>
  <p class="article-text">
    We have the same functionality with types defined with JSDoc, but I prefer
    the TypeScript method because it's
    <strong> easier and shorter to write</strong>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="article-title">TypeScript check</h3>
  <p class="article-text">
    Whether you define types with TS or JSDoc you can configure your file so
    that the editor is stricter and checks for more errors. To do so, add the
    comment
    <app-code-snippet
      language="javascript"
      [inline]="true"
      code="
    //@ts-check
    "
    ></app-code-snippet>
    at the beginning of your js files.
  </p>
  <p class="article-text">
    The following GIF shows that adding this comment checks for many errors such
    as a spelling error on a property.
    <strong
      >The error caught can now be fixed instead of going through and creating a
      bug at run time in production</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <app-fullscreen-container>
    <img
      class="w-full"
      src="assets/lwc-typing-article/TS-check.gif"
      alt="ts-check in editor"
    />
  </app-fullscreen-container>
  <p class="article-text">
    As you can see the downside is that it also triggers false positive errors
    for getters, setters and some imports. But I believe the safety you get from
    ts-check outweighs the drawbacks.
  </p>

  <h3 class="article-title">Side notes</h3>
  <h4 class="article-subtitle">deployment configuration</h4>
  <p class="article-text">
    If there are deployment problems with the TypeScript files you need to
    exclude them from the deployment steps. With the sfdx plugin you can
    configure the .forceignore file to do so.
  </p>
  <h4 class="article-subtitle">sfdx plugin uses TypeScript internally</h4>
  <p class="article-text">
    In the .sfdx folder in your project you can find *.d.ts files which are
    TypeScript definition files generated by the sfdx plugin so that the editor
    has information about the standard LWC functions and modules imported in LWC
    files. It is also used for the Apex auto-completion. The sfdx command "SFDX:
    Refresh Sobject Definition" actually updates .d.ts files that mirror the
    fields and objects that are in the Salesforce org the IDE is currently
    plugged to.
  </p>
  <h4 class="article-subtitle">jsconfig.json</h4>
  <p class="article-text">
    In each LWC folders you can find one jsconfig.json file that is generated by
    the sfdx plugin. In theory, we can add the property
    <span class="hljs-name">"target": "ES2015"</span> to this json so that our
    editor doesn't trigger errors for every getter and setter. The JavaScript
    version ES2015 does have the feature "getter & setter". This fix is not very
    practical because sfdx regularly override the jsconfig.json files. That's
    why bypassing those false positive errors with
    <app-code-snippet
      language="javascript"
      [inline]="true"
      code="
    //@ts-ignore
    "
    ></app-code-snippet>
    comments might be the solution picked.
  </p>
  <h4 class="article-subtitle">template auto-completion</h4>
  <p class="article-text">
    As of now Salesforce doesn't provide auto-completion for the HTML templates
    in the LWC components. Other famous JavaScript frameworks have this feature
    and it works very well thanks to types.
  </p>
  <h3 class="article-title">Closing words</h3>
  <p class="article-text">
    Typing LWC components with a TypeScript file and the ts-check verification
    is a
    <strong
      >quick an easy way to improve developer experience and code
      quality</strong
    >. It is <strong>noncommittal</strong> and has the advantage to be used on a
    per-file basis for tryouts.
